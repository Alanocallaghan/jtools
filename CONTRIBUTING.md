# Contributing

Contributions to `jtools` whether in the form of bug fixes, issue reports, 
new code or documentation improvement are welcome.  Please use the Github issue 
tracker if remotely possible. For any pull request please link to or open a
corresponding issue in the issue tracker. 

##  Tests

`jtools` uses `testthat` for testing. Please try to provide complete test 
coverage for any submitted code and always check that existing tests continue
to pass. If you aren't familiar with `testthat` or writing tests in general,
please indicate that in your pull request and I will likely be able to add
those tests. 

## Code style

Generally speaking, the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) 
won't steer you wrong. A few specific things to note, however:

* `<-` must be used for assignment. I may reject pull requests using `=`.
* Avoid using periods for function names and separate words with `_` in 
function names.
* In function *arguments*, use periods to separate words (not `_`). This is
a convention designed to be consistent with this package and to clearly
differentiate function arguments from other objects.
* I prefer commented code, especially if there's any ambiguity about what 
sections of code are doing on first read.
